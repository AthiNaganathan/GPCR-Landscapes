# GPCR-Landscapes

The 'mat' files can be directly loaded in MATLAB.

The document FilesAndVariables.docx has a brief description of the different file types.

WSME model outputs can be plotted for different GPCRs using the code Plot_Imp_Variables.m (input files can be modified in lines 6 and 7 of this code)

The code used for the simulations can be found in https://github.com/AthiNaganathan/WSMEmodel (remember to change dielectric constant to 4 for simulating GPCRs or any other membrane proteins!).
